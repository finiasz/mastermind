# Mastermind

This game is the classic [Masterming board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)). You have a limited number of attempts to guess a hidden color pattern. Each time you make a guess, you will know:
- how many colors are exact matches
- how many colors are correct, but are misplaced

Several settings:
- number of colors in the target pattern
- number of different colors
- allow duplicate colors
- colorblind mode, with colors of different shapes
